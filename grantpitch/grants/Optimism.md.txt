# POET for Optimism – RetroPGF Alignment

## Use Case
Retroactive public goods need proof of who did what. POET attaches that proof to each contributor, permanently.

## Funding Request
- $25,000 to deploy and run 3 DAO pilots on Optimism
- Integration with RetroPGF workflows

## Outcome
Portable, milestone-aware tokens that sync with Optimism’s public goods ethos.
