# POET on Arbitrum – Contribution + Equity Protocol

## Why Arbitrum
Built for DAOs, POET supports tokenized equity via NFTs with burn, milestone, and appeal logic.

## What We Want
- $25,000 to deploy POET on Arbitrum
- Run pilots with Arbitrum-native DAOs

## How It Helps
Makes contributor proof portable, enforceable, and interoperable across Arbitrum’s ecosystem.
