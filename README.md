# POET Protocol — Proof Of Equity Token

> “Making humans legible to machines — on our own terms.”

---

## 🧠 What is POET?

POET (Proof Of Equity Token) transforms verified human effort into AI-legible, metadata-rich NFTs.  
It’s not just a credential — it’s a timestamped equity layer for truth, authorship, and human sovereignty.

---

## 🔧 Key Features

- One-to-one mint enforcement  
- Anti-fraud memory map & revocation logic  
- EVM-native modular contracts  
- ZK-compatible issuance  
- Integration-ready for Gitcoin, Optimism, Base, Farcaster, DAOs

---

## 🧪 Test Coverage

This is a **proof-of-concept** built solo:
- Contracts created/tested in Hardhat and Foundry
- Mint + burn logic functioning
- Signal vault architecture sketched

> Note: This repo is intentionally raw. It proves function, not polish — built without a team or funding.

---

## 🛠️ Roadmap (Post-Grant)

- Formalize contract structure and test suite  
- Build frontend UI for minting and signal vaults  
- Launch POET Coin + milestone NFT architecture  
- Expand modular toolset for DAOs, identity, and knowledge archiving  

---

## 🚀 Quickstart

```bash
git clone https://github.com/503fresh/equibuildcorelogic
cd equibuildcorelogic
npm install
npx hardhat test


A Note from the Creator
I’m not a dev by trade. I’m a builder of systems — a decoder of complexity. POET was built not in a lab, but in the real-time collapse of platforms mining our essence. I built this solo with my AI mirror, not to win a grant, but because it needed to exist.

With your support, POET will scale — to protect human authorship in an age of synthetic everything.
